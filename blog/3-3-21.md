# Notes

On Monday I wrote the code for the Rules Engine of a notification system I am working on with a coworker.  A "rules engine" sounds really sophisticated and complex, but my working code only amounted to about 15 lines of code.  It basically iterates through all the rules associated with an event and returns a list of actions if the rules are active.
